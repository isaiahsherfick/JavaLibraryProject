# ABOUT THE SYSTEM

This is a full CLI library system. There are three kinds of accounts: Admin, Librarian, and Students. Admins have the ability to view / modify account information, Librarians have the ability to modify and view book information as well as Student late fees, and Students have the ability to check out, lend, and return books. All three account types have the ability to search the library's catalog. 

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR ALL USERS

	To exit the system, DO NOT close your terminal, DO NOT, keyboard interrupt the program. 
	DO type "exit" and hit enter. This saves all changes you have made during your session. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS, IT WILL NOT SAVE CHANGES.
